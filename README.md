# supermarket-simulator

The goal of this project is to build a small programm which simulates the movements of customers in a supermarkt during a full day.
There is a data set for each weekday which tracked the movement of customer in the supermarkt in the following format:


| timestamp  | customer_no | location |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2019-09-02 07:03:00 | 1  | fruits |
| 2019-09-02 07:03:00 | 2  | dairy |
